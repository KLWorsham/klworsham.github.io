					<h1>Legal Background</h1> <br>

					Katrina Worsham is a graduate from George Washington Law in 2017. She currently resides in Washington, DC. Her legal focus is cybersecurity and digital rights. She is familiar with legal issues involving copyright, the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act, and constitutional limitations of government access to private devices. <br><br>

					She has advised and worked with programmers on projects that aim to expand public awareness about new technologies. She is currently involved in a feminist cryptocurrency initiative aimed at increasing the presence of women in this area of tech.<br><br> 

					Her initial interest in coding and tech developed when she discovered web design in middle school. At 12 years old, she noticed that certain profile pages on a game called "Neopets" had unique and custom designs. Being creatively inclined, she set out to figure out how this was done.<br><br>

					Over the years, she continued exploring her programming interests alongside her academic career. She gained knowledge on encryption, peer-to-peer networks, and general connection and device security. She now combines her tech interests with her legal background to further an effective framework for the digital landscape.<br><br>
